## Active queue (in priority order — recommended sequence)

Owner can re-order; this is a recommendation.

| Order | CR | Why first |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **CR-015** | Foundation — without clean variable mapping, no template renders correctly. Unblocks CR-014 + CR-016 downstream. |
| 2 | **CR-016** | Dynamic events build on top of clean variable layer. Once both land, owner can self-serve nearly all template work. |
| 3 | **CR-014** | E-invoice link depends on (a) variables (CR-015) and (b) `send_bill` event being reliable (CR-004 P3.5 done ✅). Could ship in parallel with CR-016. |

## Out-of-sprint backlog (not yet registered)

| Idea | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Force re-send admin action for stuck-Pending rows | Suggested in CR-004 P3.5 finish summary | Owner declined backfill but per-row manual nudges may be useful |
| OR / nested condition logic | CR-016 out-of-scope | Would become CR-016b |
| Custom webhook signals (tenant-defined) | CR-016 out-of-scope | Would become CR-016c |
| Per-customer event mute / unsubscribe | CR-016 out-of-scope | Privacy / DPDP compliance CR |
| Event analytics dashboard | CR-016 out-of-scope | Read-side analytics CR |
| Multi-channel events (SMS, email, push) | CR-016 out-of-scope | Separate channel CR per provider |
| Credit notes (mutability of invoices) | CR-014 out-of-scope | GST compliance for amendments |
| Email invoice channel | CR-014 out-of-scope | When email channel exists |

## How to update this dashboard

1. After any CR phase transition, edit the row's `Phase` + `Status` + `Last touched` cells.
2. Append a row to "Recent transitions" with date + CR + from→to.
3. If a brand-new CR is registered, add a new row above the relevant section and reference its discovery doc.
4. If a CR is closed, change light to 🟢 and clear "Blockers / Owner asks" column.
